## Wordpress Experiments
This project is a sandbox for Wordpress practice. The current focal point is embedded content and page / post customization; there may (or may not) be additional styles set for themes, but at the moment it's simply a proof-of-concept.

## The process
Thanks to a [handy WP-Heroku setup](https://github.com/macminiosx/wordpress-ja-pg4wp2-heroku), I got a Wordpress Heroku app up and running, from local to deployment. Way better than paid hosting for just a sandbox!

## Why I'm doing this
As stated, just a proof-of-concept for right now. WordPress is a ubiquitous software and really nice to know!
