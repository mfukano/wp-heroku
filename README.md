## Wordpress Experiments
This project is a sandbox for Wordpress practice. The current focal point is embedded content and page / post customization; there may (or may not) be additional styles added later on for child theme practice, but at the moment it's simply a proof-of-concept.

## The process
Thanks to a [handy WP-Heroku setup repo](https://github.com/macminiosx/wordpress-ja-pg4wp2-heroku), I whipped an app together for the sake of experimentation, from local to deployment. Way better than paid hosting for just a sandbox!

## Why I'm doing this
WordPress is, to put it bluntly, everywhere. It's the most ubiquitous CMS (59%, rounded up), and powers 27% of [_all websites_](https://w3techs.com/). That's a lion's share of the market! It also benefits from being accessible from a client perspective, and customizable from a technical perspective. The fact that that many people rely on such an available system means that learning it is inherently valuable.

My goal is not to gain depth of knowledge about WordPress; I'm not a PHP genius, and I don't claim to be (but I _can_ use it, if heavily prompted to do so). Instead, I want to be able to wrap my head around page and site customization on the front end.
